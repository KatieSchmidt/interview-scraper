  "Q6: Have you played around with the new CSS Flexbox or Grid specs?\n\nTopic: CSS\nDifficulty: ⭐⭐\n\nYes. Flexbox is mainly meant for 1-dimensional layouts while Grid is meant for 2-dimensional layouts.\n\nFlexbox solves many common problems in CSS, such as vertical centering of elements within a container, sticky footer, etc. Bootstrap and Bulma are based on Flexbox, and it is probably the recommended way to create layouts these days. Have tried Flexbox before but ran into some browser incompatibility issues (Safari) in using flex-grow, and I had to rewrite my code using inline-blocks and math to calculate the widths in percentages, it wasn't a nice experience.\n\nGrid is by far the most intuitive approach for creating grid-based layouts (it better be!) but browser support is not wide at the moment.\n\n🔗 Source: codeburst.io\n💡 Don't miss: 50 More CSS Interview Questions & Answers",

  "Q8: What is DOM (Document Object Model) and how is it linked to CSS?\n\nTopic: CSS\nDifficulty: ⭐⭐\n\nThe Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent application programming interface that treats an HTML, XHTML, or XML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document.\n\nWith the Document Object Model, programmers can create and build documents, navigate their structure, and add, modify, or delete elements and content. The DOM specifies interfaces which may be used to manage XML or HTML documents.\n\nWhen a browser displays a document, it must combine the document's content with its style information. The browser converts HTML and CSS into the DOM (Document Object Model). The DOM represents the document in the computer's memory. It combines the document's content with its style.\n\n🔗 Source: en.wikipedia.org\n💡 Don't miss: 50 More CSS Interview Questions & Answers",

  "Q14: What is Observer pattern?\n\nTopic: Design Patterns\nDifficulty: ⭐⭐⭐\n\nObserver pattern (also known as Publish-Subscribe Pattern) is used when there is one-to-many relationship between objects such as if one object is modified, its dependent objects are to be notified automatically. Observer pattern falls under behavioral pattern category.\n\nAn object with a one-to-many relationship with other objects who are interested in its state is called the subject or publisher. The observers are notified whenever the state of the subject changes and can act accordingly. The subject can have any number of dependent observers which it notifies, and any number of observers can subscribe to the subject to receive such notifications.\n\nObserver pattern uses two actor classes:\n\nThe Observer (os Subscriber) abstract class provides an update() method which will be called by the subject to notify it of the subject’s state change.\nThe Subject (or Publisher) class is also an abstract class and defines four primary methods: attach(), detach(), setState(), and notify()\n\n🔗 Source: sitepoint.com\n💡 Don't miss: 45 More Design Patterns Interview Questions & Answers",

  "Q18: How does the Centralized Workflow work?\n\nTopic: Git\nDifficulty: ⭐⭐\n\nThe Centralized Workflow uses a central repository to serve as the single point-of-entry for all changes to the project. The default development branch is called master and all changes are committed into this branch.\n\nDevelopers start by cloning the central repository. In their own local copies of the project, they edit files and commit changes. These new commits are stored locally.\n\nTo publish changes to the official project, developers push their local master branch to the central repository. Before the developer can publish their feature, they need to fetch the updated central commits and rebase their changes on top of them.\n\nCompared to other workflows, the Centralized Workflow has no defined pull request or forking patterns.\n\n🔗 Source: atlassian.com\n💡 Don't miss: 26 More Git Interview Questions & Answers",

  "Q27: What is the purpose of cache busting and how can you achieve it?\n\nTopic: HTML5\nDifficulty: ⭐⭐⭐\n\nBrowsers have a cache to temporarily store files on websites so they don't need to be re-downloaded again when switching between pages or reloading the same page. The server is set up to send headers that tell the browser to store the file for a given amount of time. This greatly increases website speed and preserves bandwidth.\n\nHowever, it can cause problems when the website has been changed by developers because the user's cache still references old files. This can either leave them with old functionality or break a website if the cached CSS and JavaScript files are referencing elements that no longer exist, have moved or have been renamed.\n\nCache busting is the process of forcing the browser to download the new files. This is done by naming the file something different to the old file.\n\nA common technique to force the browser to re-download the file is to append a query string to the end of the file.\n\nsrc=\"js/script.js\" => src=\"js/script.js?v=2\"\n\nThe browser considers it a different file but prevents the need to change the file name.\n\n🔗 Source: css-tricks.com\n💡 Don't miss: 55 More HTML5 Interview Questions & Answers",

But If you use typeof undeclared_variable then it will return undefined.\n\nBefore starting further discussion let's understand the difference between declaration and definition.\n\nvar x is a declaration because you are not defining what value it holds yet, but you are declaring its existence and the need of memory allocation.\n\nvar x; // declaring x\nconsole.log(x); //output: undefined\n\n\nvar x = 1 is both declaration and definition (also we can say we are doing initialisation), Here declaration and assignment of value happen inline for variable x, In JavaScript every variable declaration and function declaration brings to the top of its current scope in which it's declared then assignment happen in order this term is called hoisting.\n\nA variable that is declared but not define and when we try to access it, It will result undefined.\n\nvar x; // Declaration\nif(typeof x === 'undefined') // Will return true\n\n\nA variable that neither declared nor defined when we try to reference such variable then It result not defined.\n\nconsole.log(y);  // Output: ReferenceError: y is not defined\n\n\n🔗 Source: stackoverflow.com\n💡 Don't miss: 116 More JavaScript Interview Questions & Answers",
  "Q39: Describe closure concept in JavaScript as best as you could\n\nTopic: JavaScript\nDifficulty: ⭐⭐⭐\n\nConsider:\n\nfunction makeAdder(x) {\n    // parameter `x` is an inner variable\n\n    // inner function `add()` uses `x`, so\n    // it has a \"closure\" over `x`\n    function add(y) {\n        return y + x;\n    };\n\n    return add;\n}\n\n\nReference to inner add function returned is able to remember what x value was passed to makeAdder function call.\n\nvar plusOne = makeAdder( 1 ); // x is 1, plusOne has a reference to add(y)\nvar plusTen = makeAdder( 10 ); // x is 10\n\nplusOne(3); // 1 (x) + 3 (y) = 4\nplusTen(13); // 10 (x) + 13 (y) = 23 \n\n\n\nIn C and most other common languages, after a function returns, all the local variables are no longer accessible because the stack-frame is destroyed.\n\nIn JavaScript, if you declare a function within another function, then the local variables can remain accessible after returning from the function you called.\n\nA closure is a stack frame which is allocated when a function starts its execution, and not freed after the function returns (as if a 'stack frame' were allocated on the heap rather than the stack!). In JavaScript, you can think of a function reference variable as having both a pointer to a function as well as a hidden pointer to a closure.\n\n🔗 Source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/111102/how-do-javascript-closures-work\n💡 Don't miss: 116 More JavaScript Interview Questions & Answers",

  "Q47: What is SQL injection?\n\nTopic: Web Security\nDifficulty: ⭐\n\nInjection attacks stem from a lack of strict separation between program instructions (i.e., code) and user-provided (or external) input. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into a data snippet.\n\nSQL injection is one of the most common types of injection attack. To carry it out, an attacker provides malicious SQL statements through the application.\n\nHow to prevent:\n\nPrepared statements with parameterized queries\nStored procedures\nInput validation - blacklist validation and whitelist validation\nPrinciple of least privilege - Application accounts shouldn’t assign DBA or admin type access onto the database server. This ensures that if an application is compromised, an attacker won’t have the rights to the database through the compromised application.\n\n🔗 Source: https://www.synopsys.com\n💡 Don't miss: 58 More Web Security Interview Questions & Answers",
